      "The invention of the first powered, heavier-than-air aircraft is credited to the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright. They designed, built, and flew the first successful airplane on December 17, 1903.\n",

      "However, there were other inventors and aviation pioneers who made significant contributions to the development of flight before the Wright brothers. Some notable examples include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sir George Cayley (1773-1857): An English engineer and inventor, Cayley is often credited with designing the first successful glider in 1853. He also identified the principles of lift, drag, and thrust that are still used in aircraft design today.\n",
      "2. Otto Lilienthal (1848-1896): A German engineer and aviation pioneer, Lilienthal made significant contributions to the development of gliders and was a major influence on the Wright brothers.\n",
      "3. Octave Chanute (1832-1910): A French-American engineer and aviation pioneer, Chanute was a prominent figure in the development of aviation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He designed and built several gliders and powered aircraft, and was a mentor to the Wright brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if we consider the first powered, controlled, and sustained flight, it was achieved by the Wright brothers on December 17, 1903. On that day, Orville piloted the first flight, which lasted for 12 seconds and covered a distance of 120 feet. Wilbur piloted the fourth and final flight of the day, which lasted for 59 seconds and covered a distance of 852 feet.\n",
